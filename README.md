 # Fedora 41 Post Install Guide
 Things to do after installing Fedora 41 (specially for Dell XPS 9570) 
 
## Faster Updates
* `sudo nano /etc/dnf/dnf.conf` 
* Copy and replace the text with the following:
```
[main]
skip_if_unavailable=True 
max_parallel_downloads=10 
```

## RPM Fusion
Fedora has disabled the repositories for a lot of free and non-free .rpm packages by default. Follow this if you want to use non-free software like Steam, Discord and some multimedia codecs etc. As a general rule of thumb it is advised to do this to get access to many mainstream useful programs.

If you forgot to enable third party repositories during the initial setup window, enable them by pasting the following into the terminal: 
```
sudo dnf install https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
sudo dnf update @core
```

## Update 
* Go into the software center and click on update. Alternatively, you can use the following commands:
```
sudo dnf -y update
sudo dnf -y upgrade --refresh
```
* Reboot

## Firmware
* If your system supports firmware update delivery through lvfs, update your device firmware by:
```
sudo fwupdmgr get-devices 
sudo fwupdmgr refresh --force 
sudo fwupdmgr get-updates 
sudo fwupdmgr update
```

## Flatpak
* Fedora doesn't include all non-free flatpaks by default. The command below enables access to all the flathub flatpaks. Particularly useful for users of Fedora KDE and other spins since they do not get the "Enable Third Party Repositories" option on initial boot.
* `flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo`

## NVIDIA Drivers
* Only follow this if you have a NVIDIA gpu. Also, don't follow this if you have a gpu which has dropped support for newer driver releases i.e. anything earlier than nvidia GT/GTX 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1600 and RTX 2000, 3000, 4000 series. Fedora comes preinstalled with NOUVEAU drivers which may or may not work better on those remaining older GPUs. This should be followed by Desktop and Laptop users alike.
* Disable Secure Boot.
* `sudo dnf update` #To make sure you're on the latest kernel and then reboot.
* Enable RPM Fusion Nvidia non-free repository in the app store and install it from there,
* or alternatively
* `sudo dnf install akmod-nvidia`
* Install this if you use applications that can utilise CUDA i.e. Davinci Resolve, Blender etc.
* `sudo dnf install xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-cuda`
* Wait for atleast 5 mins before rebooting, to let the kermel module get built.
* `modinfo -F version nvidia` #Check if the kernel module is built.
* Reboot
* Test whether the drivers have been installed correctly:

```shell
lsmod | grep nvidia
modinfo -V nvidia
__NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia glxinfo | grep vendor
```

The output should look like this:
```
nvidia_drm            118784  4
nvidia_modeset       1585152  2 nvidia_drm
nvidia_uvm           3522560  0
nvidia              62394368  37 nvidia_uvm,nvidia_modeset
video                  77824  4 dell_wmi,dell_laptop,i915,nvidia_modeset
kmod version 30
+ZSTD +XZ +ZLIB +LIBCRYPTO -EXPERIMENTAL
server glx vendor string: SGI
client glx vendor string: NVIDIA Corporation
OpenGL vendor string: NVIDIA Corporation
```

* Last, but not least, let's fix a sleep state problem that's happening to XPS 15s, including, but not limited to, 9560s and 9570s:
```sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args="mem_sleep_default=deep"```

## Media Codecs
* Install these to get proper multimedia playback.
````
sudo dnf swap 'ffmpeg-free' 'ffmpeg' --allowerasing # Switch to full FFMPEG.
sudo dnf group install multimedia
sudo dnf update @multimedia --setopt="install_weak_deps=False" --exclude=PackageKit-gstreamer-plugin # Installs gstreamer components. Required if you use Gnome Videos and other dependent applications.
sudo dnf install @sound-and-video # Installs useful Sound and Video complement packages.
````

## H/W Video Acceleration
* Helps decrease load on the CPU when watching videos online by alloting the rendering to the dGPU/iGPU. Quite helpful in increasing battery backup on laptops.

### H/W Video Decoding with VA-API 
```
sudo dnf install ffmpeg ffmpeg-libs libva libva-utils
sudo dnf swap libva-intel-media-driver intel-media-driver --allowerasing
```

### OpenH264 for Firefox
After this enable the OpenH264 Plugin in Firefox's settings.
```
sudo dnf config-manager setopt fedora-cisco-openh264.enabled=1
sudo dnf install -y openh264 gstreamer1-plugin-openh264 mozilla-openh264
```

## Set Hostname
```hostnamectl set-hostname YOUR_HOSTNAME```

## Custom DNS Servers
For people that want to setup custom DNS servers for better privacy
```
sudo mkdir -p '/etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d' && sudo -e '/etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/99-dns-over-tls.conf'

[Resolve]
DNS=1.1.1.2#security.cloudflare-dns.com 1.0.0.2#security.cloudflare-dns.com 2606:4700:4700::1112#security.cloudflare-dns.com 2606:4700:4700::1002#security.cloudflare-dns.com
DNSOverTLS=yes
```

## Set UTC Time
Used to counter time inconsistencies in dual boot systems
```sudo timedatectl set-local-rtc '0'```

## Optimizations
* The tips below can allow you to squeeze out a little bit more performance from your system. 

### Disable Mitigations 
Increases performance in multithreaded systems. The more cores you have in your cpu the greater the performance gain. 5-30% performance gain varying upon systems. Do not follow this if you share services and files through your network or are using fedora in a VM. 

Modern intel CPUs (above 10th gen) do not gain noticeable performance improvements upon disabling mitigations. Hence, disabling mitigations can present some security risks against various attacks, however, it still _might_ increase the CPU performance of your system.
```sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args="mitigations=off"```

### Enable nvidia-modeset 
Useful if you have a laptop with an Nvidia GPU. Necessary for some PRIME-related interoperability features.
```sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args="nvidia-drm.modeset=1"```

### Disable `NetworkManager-wait-online.service`
Disabling it can decrease the boot time by at least ~15s-20s:
```sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager-wait-online.service```

### Disable Gnome Software from Startup Apps
Gnome software autostarts on boot for some reason, even though it is not required on every boot unless you want it to do updates in the background, this takes at least 100MB of RAM upto 900MB (as reported anecdotically). You can stop it from autostarting by:
```sudo rm /etc/xdg/autostart/org.gnome.Software.desktop```
