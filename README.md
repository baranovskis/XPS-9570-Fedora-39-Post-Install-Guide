 # Fedora 39 Post Install Guide
 Things to do after installing Fedora 39 (specially for Dell XPS 9570) 
 
## Faster Updates
* `sudo nano /etc/dnf/dnf.conf` 
* Copy and replace the text with the following:
```
[main] 
gpgcheck=1 
installonly_limit=3 
clean_requirements_on_remove=True 
best=False 
skip_if_unavailable=True 
fastestmirror=1 
max_parallel_downloads=10 
deltarpm=true
``` 
* Note: The `fastestmirror=1` plugin can be counterproductive at times, use it at your own discretion. Set it to `fastestmirror=0` if you are facing bad download speeds. Many users have reported better download speeds with the plugin enables so it is there by default.

## RPM Fusion
* Fedora has disabled the repositories for a lot of free and non-free .rpm packages by default. Follow this if you want to use non-free software like Steam, Discord and some multimedia codecs etc. As a general rule of thumb its advised to do this get access to many mainstream useful programs.
* `sudo dnf install https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm`
* also while you're at it, install app-stream metadata by
* `sudo dnf groupupdate core`

## Update 
* `sudo dnf -y update`
* `sudo dnf -y upgrade --refresh`
* Reboot

## Firmware
* If your system supports firmware update delivery through lvfs, update your device firmware by:
```
sudo fwupdmgr get-devices 
sudo fwupdmgr refresh --force 
sudo fwupdmgr get-updates 
sudo fwupdmgr update
```

## NVIDIA Drivers
* Only follow this if you have a NVIDIA gpu. Also, don't follow this if you have a gpu which has dropped support for newer driver releases i.e. anything earlier than nvidia GT/GTX 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1600 and RTX 2000, 3000, 4000 series. Fedora comes preinstalled with NOUVEAU drivers which may or may not work better on those remaining older GPUs. This should be followed by Desktop and Laptop users alike.
* Disable Secure Boot.
* `sudo dnf install gcc kernel-headers kernel-devel akmod-nvidia xorg-x11-drv-nvidia xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-libs xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-libs.i686 xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-power`
* [Optional] `sudo dnf install xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-cuda`
* `sudo dnf install vulkan`
* [Optional] `sudo dnf install vdpauinfo libva-vdpau-driver libva-utils`
* Wait for at least 5 mins before the next step, to let the kernel module get built.
* Force the akmods to rebuild.
* `sudo akmods --force`
* `sudo dracut --force`
* Wait another 5 minutes.
* Reboot.
* Test whether the drivers have been installed correctly:

```shell
lsmod | grep nvidia
modinfo -V nvidia
__NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia glxinfo | grep vendor
```

* The output should look like this:

```
nvidia_drm            118784  4
nvidia_modeset       1585152  2 nvidia_drm
nvidia_uvm           3522560  0
nvidia              62394368  37 nvidia_uvm,nvidia_modeset
video                  77824  4 dell_wmi,dell_laptop,i915,nvidia_modeset
kmod version 30
+ZSTD +XZ +ZLIB +LIBCRYPTO -EXPERIMENTAL
server glx vendor string: SGI
client glx vendor string: NVIDIA Corporation
OpenGL vendor string: NVIDIA Corporation
```

* Last, but not least, let's fix a sleep state problem that's happening to XPS 15s, including, but not limited to, 9560s and 9570s:
* `sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args="mem_sleep_default=deep"`

## Battery Life
* Follow this if you have a Laptop and are facing sub optimal battery backup.
* power-profiles-daemon which come pre-configured works great on a great majority of systems but still in case you're facing sub-optimal battery backup you try installing tlp by:
* `sudo dnf install tlp tlp-rdw`
* `sudo systemctl start tlp`
* `sudo systemctl enable tlp`
* and mask power-profiles-daemon by:
* `sudo systemctl mask power-profiles-daemon`
* and mask systemd-rfkill by:
* `sudo systemctl mask systemd-rfkill.service systemd-rfkill.socket`
* Also install powertop by:
* `sudo dnf install powertop`
* `sudo systemctl start powertop`
* `sudo systemctl enable powertop`
* `sudo powertop --auto-tune`

## Media Codecs
* Install these to get proper multimedia playback.
````
sudo dnf groupupdate 'core' 'multimedia' 'sound-and-video' --setop='install_weak_deps=False' --exclude='PackageKit-gstreamer-plugin' --allowerasing && sync
sudo dnf swap 'ffmpeg-free' 'ffmpeg' --allowerasing
sudo dnf install gstreamer1-plugins-{bad-\*,good-\*,base} gstreamer1-plugin-openh264 gstreamer1-libav --exclude=gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free-devel ffmpeg gstreamer-ffmpeg
sudo dnf install lame\* --exclude=lame-devel
sudo dnf group upgrade --with-optional Multimedia
````

## H/W Video Acceleration
* Helps decrease load on the CPU when watching videos online by alloting the rendering to the dGPU/iGPU. It is quite helpful in increasing battery backup on laptops.

### H/W Video Decoding with VA-API 
* `sudo dnf install ffmpeg ffmpeg-libs libva libva-utils`
* `sudo dnf install intel-media-driver`

### OpenH264 for Firefox
* `sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled fedora-cisco-openh264`
* `sudo dnf install -y openh264 gstreamer1-plugin-openh264 mozilla-openh264`
* After this enable the OpenH264 Plugin in Firefox's settings.

## Update Flatpak
* `flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo`
* `flatpak update`

## Set Hostname
* `hostnamectl set-hostname YOUR_HOSTNAME`

## Custom DNS Servers
* For people that want to setup custom DNS servers for better privacy
```
sudo mkdir -p '/etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d' && sudo -e '/etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/99-dns-over-tls.conf'

[Resolve]
DNS=1.1.1.2#security.cloudflare-dns.com 1.0.0.2#security.cloudflare-dns.com 2606:4700:4700::1112#security.cloudflare-dns.com 2606:4700:4700::1002#security.cloudflare-dns.com
DNSOverTLS=yes
```
## Set UTC Time
* Used to counter time inconsistencies in dual boot systems
* `sudo timedatectl set-local-rtc '0'`

## Optimizations
* The tips below can allow you to squeeze out a little bit more performance from your system. 

### Disable Mitigations 
* Increases performance in multithreaded systems. The more cores you have in your cpu the greater the performance gain. 5-30% performance gain varying upon systems. Do not follow this if you share services and files through your network or are using fedora in a VM. 
* Modern intel CPUs (above 10th gen) do not gain noticeable performance improvements upon disabling mitigations. Hence, disabling mitigations can present some security risks against various attacks, however, it still _might_ increase the CPU performance of your system.
* `sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args="mitigations=off"`

### Enable nvidia-modeset 
* Useful if you have a laptop with an Nvidia GPU. Necessary for some PRIME-related interoperability features.
* `sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args="nvidia-drm.modeset=1"`

### Disable `NetworkManager-wait-online.service`
* Disabling it can decrease the boot time by at least ~15s-20s:
* `sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager-wait-online.service`

### Disable Gnome Software from Startup Apps
* Gnome software autostarts on boot for some reason, even though it is not required on every boot unless you want it to do updates in the background, this takes at least 100MB of RAM upto 900MB (as reported anecdotically). You can stop it from autostarting by:
* `sudo rm /etc/xdg/autostart/org.gnome.Software.desktop`
